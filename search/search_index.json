Whether it's energy consumption, e-waste, or the digital carbon footprint of the data centers powering our apps, we cannot ignore our industry's environmental effects.</p> <p>I strive to build solutions that are not only efficient and performant, but also sustainable. This includes prioritizing energy-efficient algorithms, advocating for serverless architectures to reduce wasted resources, and implementing responsible e-waste policies.</p>"},{"location":"#spiritually-informed-technology","title":"\ud83c\udf14 Spiritually-Informed Technology","text":"<p>In addition to being ecologically aware, my work is guided by spiritual principles. For me, this doesn't necessarily relate to any particular religion, but more about a profound sense of connection and respect for all life and consciousness.</p> <p>In my tech journey, this translates to developing software with empathy and mindfulness, considering the impact on all stakeholders - from end-users to the broader community, even the planet. I believe in the power of technology to uplift, heal, and connect us, not just monetize or exploit our attention.</p>"},{"location":"#lets-connect","title":"\ud83e\udd1d Let's Connect","text":"<p>I love connecting[^1] with others who share these values, so please feel free to get in touch!
