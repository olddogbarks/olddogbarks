# Welcome!

I'm Christopher, a ‚Äúsometimes working‚Äù retired content developer and part-time coder with a passion for contributing to a healthier, more balanced world. My work is rooted not just in technical proficiency but also in the principles of ecological awareness and spirituality. 

## üåø Ecological Awareness in Tech 

The technology we create has an enormous impact on our planet. Whether it's energy consumption, e-waste, or the digital carbon footprint of the data centers powering our apps, we cannot ignore our industry's environmental effects.

I strive to build solutions that are not only efficient and performant, but also sustainable. This includes prioritizing energy-efficient algorithms, advocating for serverless architectures to reduce wasted resources, and implementing responsible e-waste policies.

## üåî Spiritually-Informed Technology 

In addition to being ecologically aware, my work is guided by spiritual principles. For me, this doesn't necessarily relate to any particular religion, but more about a profound sense of connection and respect for all life and consciousness.

In my tech journey, this translates to developing software with empathy and mindfulness, considering the impact on all stakeholders - from end-users to the broader community, even the planet. I believe in the power of technology to uplift, heal, and connect us, not just monetize or exploit our attention.

## ü§ù Let's Connect

I love connecting[^1] with others who share these values, so please feel free to get in touch! Whether you‚Äôre working on an eco-conscious project, exploring the intersection of tech and spirituality, or just want to chat, I'd be thrilled to connect and learn from each other.
